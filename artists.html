                famous for designing limited edition toys and clothing. Born in

                such as 101 Dalmations, Daria, and Doug. He then had the
                opportunity to design limited edition vinyl toys which were a big
                success in Japan. Recently, he has done collaborations with Nike,
                Vans, and Hennessy.

                David Choe Was born on April 21, 1976 and spent his childhood in
                Koreatown, Los Angeles. He is an American figure painter,
                muralist, graffiti artist and graphic novelist of Korean descent.
                His paintings illustrate a theme of desire, degradation, and
                exaltation, with a raw tone, that he himself has named “dirty style”. 
                In 2007, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg hired Choe to paint murals
                for their office in exchange for stock shares which ended up
                being worth $200 million in 2012.
